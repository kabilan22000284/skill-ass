### Aim: To Design and simulate 9 bit parity generator using Verilog.
### HARDWARE REQUIRED:  – PC, Cyclone II , USB flasher
### SOFTWARE REQUIRED:   Quartus prime
### THEORY 

##what is 9 bit parity generator?
 These universal 9-bit parity generators/checkers utilize advanced Schottky high-performance circuitry and feature odd (Σ ODD) and even (Σ EVEN) outputs to facilitate operation of either odd- or even-parity applications. The word-length capability is easily expanded by cascading.
